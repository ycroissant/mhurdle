# Introduction

Data collected by means of households' expenditure survey may present
a large proportion of zero expenditures due to many households
recording, for one reason or another, no expenditure for some
items. Analyzing these data requires to model any expenditure with a
large proportion of nil observations as a dependent variable left
censored at zero.

Since the seminal paper of @TOBIN/58, a large econometric
literature has been developed to deal correctly with this problem of
zero observations. The problem of censored data has also been treated
for a long time in the statistics literature dealing with survival
models.

In applied microeconometrics, different decision mechanisms have been
put forward to explain the appearance of zero expenditure
observations. The original Tobin's model takes only one of these
mechanisms into account. With `mhurdle`, up to three mechanisms
generating zero expenditure observations may be introduced in the
model^[his package is a new version of a package first developed as
part of a PhD dissertation carried out by St\'ephane @HOAR/09 at the
University of Reunion under the supervision of Fabrizio Carlevaro and
Yves Croissant.]. More specifically, we consider the following three
zero expenditure generating mechanisms.


- A good selection mechanism (hurdle 1). According to this
  mechanism, the consumer\footnote{The consumer we are referring to is
    that of the microeconomic theory, an abstract economic agent
    responsible of the decisions of a consumption unit that may be an
    individual, a family, a household. According to the economic
    literature, we term this concept "the consumer" by
    convenience.} first decides which goods to include in its choice
  set and, as a consequence, he can discard some marketed goods
  because he dislikes them (like meat for vegetarians or wine for
  non-drinkers) or considers them harmful (like alcohol, cigarettes,
  inorganic food, holidays in dangerous countries), among
  others.
  
  This censoring mechanism has been introduced in empirical demand
  analysis by @CRAGG/71. It allows to account for the
  non-consumption of a good as a consequence of a fundamentally
  non-economic decision motivated by ethical, psychological or social
  considerations altering the consumer's preferences.

- A desired consumption mechanism (hurdle 2). According to this
  mechanism, once a good has been selected, the consumer decides which
  amount to consume and, as a consequence of his preferences,
  resources and selected good prices, its rational decision can turn
  out to be a
  negative desired consumption level leading to a nil consumption.
  
  The use of this mechanism, to explain the presence of zero
  observations in family expenditure surveys, was introduced by
  @TOBIN/58. Its theoretical relevance has been later rationalized by
  the existence of corner solutions to the microeconomic problem of
  rational choice of the neoclassical consumer.^[See section 10.2 of
  @AMEM/85, for an elementary presentation of this issue, and chapter
  4 of @PUDNEY/89, for a more comprehensive one.] @CRAGG/71's
  combination of this desired consumption mechanism and the selection
  mechanism leads a double hurdle model, also called two-part model,
  which has been extended by @BLUNDELL/87 to the case where the two
  equations are correlated.

- A purchasing mechanism (hurdle 3). According to this mechanism,
  once a consumption decision has been taken, the consumer sets up the
  schedule at which to buy the good and, as a consequence of its
  purchasing strategy, a zero expenditure may be observed if the survey
  by which these data are collected is carried out over a too short
  period with respect to the frequency at which the good is bought. 
  
  This censoring mechanism has been introduced in empirical demand
  analysis by @DEATO/IRISH/84. It allows to account for the
  non-purchase of a good not because the good is not consumed but
  because it is an infrequently bought good or service. This is
  typically the case for durable or storable non durable goods,
  but also for many infrequently bought services like health, leisure,
  education and training services. Remarkably, this mechanism allows
  to derive from observed expenditures the rate of use of a durable
  good, the rate of consumption of a stored non durable good, and
  the rate of purchase of an infrequently consumed non storable
  non durable good or service.


For each of these censoring mechanisms, a continuous latent variable
is defined, indicating that censoring is in effect when the latent
variable is negative. These latent variables are modeled as functions
of explanatory variables and of a random disturbance, with a possible
correlation between the disturbances of different latent variables in
order to account for a possible simultaneity of the decisions modeled
by censoring mechanisms.  To model possible departures of the observed
dependent variable from normality, as it is common with economic
variables, we use transformations of this variable allowing to rescale
non normal random variables to normality.  By combining part or the
whole set of these censoring mechanisms, we generate a set of
non-nested parametric models that can be used to explain censored
expenditure data depending on the structural censoring mechanisms that
a priori information suggests to be at work.

These formal models have been primarily developed to deal with
censored household expenditure data, and numerous applications have
been carried out in this field.  @SMITH:02 presented an overview of
these studies. Using an updated overview of these studies carried out
by ourselves, we note a late popularity of Cragg's approach, as the
first applications of hurdle models are published in the late of
1980s, namely almost two decades after the publication of @CRAGG/71 's
paper. Since then, a large variety of demand models including one or
two among the previous three censoring mechanisms are estimated.
However, none of these studies use the three censoring mechanisms we
consider, jointly.  From the 1990s on, many studies account for
deviations of the desired consumption relation to homoscedasticity and
normality by modeling the standard error of this variable as a non
negative parametric function of some explanatory variables and by
transforming its distribution to normality using either the
logarithmic, the Box-Cox or the inverse hyperbolic sine
transformations. The estimation of a correlation coefficient between
disturbances is also performed in several of these studies, with an
increasing success over time, in terms of statistical significance of
estimates.

The practical scope of multiple hurdle Tobit models is not restricted
to empirical demand analysis but has been fruitfully used in other
fields of economics. This includes labor economics, contingent
valuation studies, finance, sport activities, internet use, gambling,
production.

Our hurdle models are specified as fully parametric models allowing
estimation and inference within an efficient maximum likelihood
framework. In order to identify a relevant model specification,
goodness of fit measures for model evaluation as well as Vuong tests
for discriminating between nested and non nested models have been
implemented in `mhurdle` package. Vuong tests remarkably permit to
compare two competing models when neither of them contain the true
mechanism generating the sample of observations. More precisely, such
tests allow to assess which of the two competing models is closest to
the true unknown model according to the Kullback-Leibler information
criterion. Therefore, such tests are not intended, as classical
Neyman-Pearson tests, to pinpoint the chimeric true model, but to
identify a best parametric model specification (with respect to
available observations) among a set of competing specifications. As a
consequence, they can provide inconclusive results, which prevent from
disentangling some competing models, and when they are conclusive,
they don't guarantee an identification of the relevant model
specification.

Survival models are implemented in `R` with the `survival` package of
@SURVA/08. It has also close links with the problem of selection bias,
for which some methods are implemented in the `sampleSelection`
package of @TOOME/HENNI/08. It is also worth mentioning that a
convenient interface to `survreg`, called `tobit`, particularly aimed
at econometric applications is available in the `AER` package of
@KLEI/ZEIL/08. More enhanced censored regression models (left and
right censoring, random effect models) are available in the `censReg`
package [@HENN:13]. Some flavor of hurdle models have also been
developed for count data and are implemented in the `hurdle` function
of the `pscl` package [@ZEIL:KLEI:JACK:08].


The paper is organised as follows: Section 2
presents the rationale of our modelling strategy.  Section
3 presents the theoretical framework for model
estimation, evaluation and selection. Section 4
discusses the software rationale used in the package. Section
5 illustrates the use of **mhurdle** with a
real-world example. Section 6 concludes.


# Modelling strategy

## Model specification

Our modeling strategy is intended to model the level $y$ of
expenditures of a household for a given good or service during a given
period of observation.  To this purpose, we use up to three zero
expenditure generating mechanisms, called hurdles, and a demand
function.

Each hurdle is represented by a qualitative binary response model
resting on one of the following three latent dependent variables
relations: 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:threeeqs)
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l} 
y_1^* = \beta_1^\top x_1 + z_1 \\[4pt] 
T(y_2^*) = \beta_2^\top x_2 + \sigma z_2 \\[4pt] 
y_3^* = \beta_3^\top x_3 + z_3 \\ 
\end{array} 
\right.
\end{equation} 


where $y_1^*$, $y_2^*$, $y_3^*$ stand for continuous latent dependent
variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ for column-vectors of explanatory
variables (called covariates in the followings), $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$,
$\beta_3$ for column-vectors of the impact coefficients of the
explanatory variables on the latent dependent variables, $z_1$, $z_2$,
$z_3$ for standard normal random disturbances.  Since variables
$y_1^*$ and $y_3^*$ are never observed, contrary to $y_2^*$, the units
of measurement of $y_1^*$ and $y_3^*$ are not identified. Hence, the
disturbances in the corresponding binary response models are
normalized by setting their variances equal to 1.

Relying on a @JOHN:49's proposal, $T(\cdot)$ denotes a differentiable
one-to-one transformation intended to rescale a potentially not
normally distributed random variable $y_2^*$ into a normally
distributed ones, with $\sigma$ standard deviation. As the domain of
definition of the inverse transformation $T^{-1}(\cdot)$ my be
restrained to a subset of real numbers, the standard normal random
disturbance $z_2$ is potentially truncated at the bounds of an
interval $[B_1,B_2]$ with $B_1$ and/or $B_2$ finite. To account for
heteroscedasticity of $z_2$, in `mhurdle` the standard deviation
$\sigma$ can be specified as a positive monotonic transformation of a
linear function of a vector of covariates $x_4$, namely $\beta_4^\top
x_4$. However, for notational simplicity, we will adopt in what
follows the notation of an homoscedastic standard deviation $\sigma$
rather than the more general one of an heteroscedastic standard
deviation $\sigma(\beta_4^\top x_4)$. ^[For a practical application of
this parametric model of heteroscedasticity, a functional form of
$\sigma(\beta_4^\top x_4)$ written as $\exp\{\beta_{40}F(\beta_4^\top
x_4)\}$, where $F(.)$ is the distribution function of the standard
normal random variable, has been programmed in `mhurdle`. This
functional form remains bounded with respect to any possible values of
covariates $x_4$ and allows testing the assumption of
homoscedasticity, $\sigma=\exp\{\beta_{40}/2\}$, by assessing the
statistical non significance of parameter vector $\beta_4$ without an
intercept.]

These equations model the hurdles, namely the sequence of binary
decisions a consumer faces when buying a good. Each hurdle decision is
coded by a binary variable $I_j$ taking value 1 if $y_j^*>0$ and $0$
otherwise.  Therefore, the outcome of each of such decisions is
modeled as a probit model with outcome probabilities: $\mbox{P}(I_j =
1) =\mbox{P}(y_j^*>0)$ and $\mbox{P}(I_j = 0) =1-\mbox{P}(y_j^*>0)$.

By assuming that consumption and purchases are uniformly distributed
over time, but according to different timetables entailing a frequency
of consumption higher than that of purchasing, we can also interpret
the probability $\mbox{P}(I_3=1)=\mbox{P}(y_3^*>0)$ as measuring the
share of purchasing frequency to that of consumption during the
observation period. This allows to relate the observed level of
expenditures $y$ to the unobserved level of consumption $y_2^*$ during
the observation period, using the following identity:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:expcons)
  y = \frac{T^{-1} (\beta_2^\top x_2 + \sigma z_2)}{\mbox{P}(I_3=1)} I_1 I_2 I_3 .
\end{equation}

This modeling strategy provides an explanatory framework where
censoring of the observed dependent variable results from the effect
of up to three different censoring mechanisms, namely: $I_1=0$ and/or
$I_2=0$ and/or $I_3=0$.

A priori information (theoretical or real-world knowledge) may suggest
that one or more of these censoring mechanisms are not in effect. For
instance, we know in advance that all households purchase food
regularly, implying that the first two censoring mechanisms are
inoperative for food.  In this case, the relevant model is defined by
only two relations: one defining the desired consumption level of food
and the other the decision to purchase food during the observation
period.

When the first and/or the third hurdles are supposed not to be in
effect, the previous binary response models for $I_1$ and/or $I_3$
must be replaced by singular probability response models where
$\mbox{P}(I_1)=1$ and/or $\mbox{P}(I_3)=1$.  When the second hurdle is
supposed to be inoperative, we must not only replace the binary
response model explaining $I_2$ by a singular probability response
model where $\mbox{P}(I_2 = 1) =1$ but also select a monotonic
transformation $T(y_2^*)$ enforcing non-negative values to $y_2^*$.

@CRAGG/71 suggested two types of functional forms of the distribution
of $y_2^*$ enforcing such constraint, namely the (inverse) log-normal
distribution:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:lognorm)
y_2^* =\exp\{\beta_2^\top x_2+\sigma z_2\}
\end{equation} 

and the normal distribution left-truncated at $0$:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:trunc)
y_2^* =\max \{0;\beta_2^\top x_2+\sigma
z_2\}=\beta_2^\top x_2 + \sigma \max \{B_1;z_2\} 
\end{equation}

where $\max \{B_1;z_2\}$ is a standard
normal random variable left-truncated at $B_1=-\beta_2^\top
x_2/\sigma$.

To account for these two functional forms within our general formal
framework \@ref(eq:threeeqs) and illustrate in section 5 their
empirical use with `mhurdle`, in this paper we consider two
transformations $T(y_2^*)$.^[To model possible departures of the
observed dependent variable $y$ from normality towards distributions
of the kind encountered with real-world economic data, two families of
flexible parametric transformations $T(.)$ were programmed in
`mhurdle`, namely the two parameter @BOX:COX:64 transformation, as
suggested by @LANK/WYCK/91 and @CHAZ:05, and @JOHN:49's one parameter
inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. The first family, which
includes transformations \@ref(eq:trunc) and \@ref(eq:lognorm2) as
special cases, generates a broad range of skewed distributions, while
the second family generates a broad range of symmetric leptokurtic
(more sharply peaked than the normal) distributions.]

The first transformation is the identity transformation which
generates an un-truncated normal distribution of $y_2^*$ when hurdle 2
is in effect, and the left-truncated normal distribution \@ref(eq:trunc)
when hurdle 2 is not in effect.

The second transformation is a slight generalization of the
logarithmic transformation leading to the (inverse) log-normal
distribution \@ref(eq:lognorm), namely:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:lognorm2)
T(y_2^*) = \ln (y_2^* + \alpha) 
\end{equation} 

with $\alpha$ a location parameter which shifts the left-truncation
bound of $y_2^*$ towards negative or positive values according to the
sign of $\alpha$.  As the inverse of this transformation is written
as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:lognorm2i)
y_2^* = \exp\{\beta_2^\top x_2+\sigma
z_2\} - \alpha 
\end{equation} 

it turns out that this transformation allows to model skewed
distributions of $y_2^*$ according to a translated (inverse)
log-normal functional form where the support of $z_2$ is
un-truncated. By the same token, testing the statistical significance
of parameter $\alpha$, against the alternative $\alpha > 0$, amounts
to testing the assumption that hurdle 2 is not in effect. Conversely,
when $\alpha < 0$ the transformation \@ref(eq:lognorm2) holds for
$y_2^* > -\alpha$ meaning that $-\alpha$ stands for a "committed"
consumption of a basic necessity, while $\alpha > 0$ typify a luxury
good whose consumption occurs only above a given income threshold.
^[This economic interpretation of parameter $\alpha$ my justify to
model this parameter as a function of some covariates, like household
demographic characteristics.]

To derive the form of the probability distribution of the observable
dependent variable $y$, we must still specify the joint distribution
of the random disturbances entering the hurdle relations assumed to be
in effect and that of the demand function, which in turn depends on
the domain of definition of transformation $T^{-1}(\cdot)$.

For trivariate hurdle models, where hurdles 1 and 3 are in effect (but
not necessarily hurdle 2), the joint density function of $z_1$, $z_2$
and $z_3$ is a possibly truncated standard trivariate normal density
function written as: 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:trivdens)
\phi\left(z_1,z_2,z_3;\rho \right)/\Pi 
\end{equation} 

where $\Pi=\Phi(B_2)-\Phi(B_1)$ with $\Phi(z)$ the distribution
function of a standard univariate normal distribution,
$\phi(z_1,z_2,z_3;\rho)$ the density function of a standard trivariate
normal distribution with $\rho$ the vector of the three symmetric
correlation coefficients $\rho_{12}$, $\rho_{13}$, $\rho_{23}$ between
the couples of normal standard random variables $z_1$ and $z_2$, $z_1$
and $z_3$, $z_2$ and $z_3$, respectively.

For bivariate hurdle models, where either hurdle 1 or hurdle 3 is not
in effect, the joint density function of $z_i$, with $i=1$ or $3$, and
$z_2$ is a possibly truncated standard bivariate normal density
function written as: 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:bivdens)
\phi\left(z_i,z_2;\rho_{i2}\right)/\Pi 
\end{equation} 

where $\phi\left(z_i,z_2;\rho_{i2}\right)$ denotes the density
function of a standard bivariate normal distribution.

Finally, for univariate hurdle models, where both hurdles 1 and 3 are
not in effect, the density function of $z_2$ is a possibly truncated
standard univariate normal density function:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:unidens)
\phi(z_2)/\Pi 
\end{equation} 

where $\phi(z_2)$ denotes the density function of a standard
univariate normal distribution.

While the assumption of correlated disturbances is intended to account
for the interdependence between latent variables $y_1^*$, $y_2^*$ and
$y_3^*$ unexplained by covariates $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$, a priori
information (theoretical or real-world knowledge) may also suggest to
set to zero some or all correlations between the random disturbances
entering these models, entailing a partial or total independence
between model relations. The use of this a priori information
generates, for each trivariate or bivariate hurdle model, a subset of
special models all nested within the general model from which they are
derived. For a trivariate hurdle model the number of special models so
derived is equal to seven, but for a bivariate hurdle model only one
special model is generated, namely the model obtained by assuming the
independence between the two random disturbances of the model.

## Probability distribution of censored dependent variable

\newcommand{\vsup}[1]{\overline{#1}}
\newcommand{\vinf}[1]{\underline{#1}}

\renewcommand{\vsup}[1]{B}
\renewcommand{\vinf}[1]{A}

As for the standard Tobit model, the probability distribution of the
observed censored variable $y$ of our hurdle models is a
discrete-continuous mixture, which assigns a probability mass
$\mbox{P}(y=0)$ to $y=0$ and a density function $f_+(y)$ to any $y>0$,
with:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:sumone)
\mbox{P}(y=0)+\int_0^\infty
f_+(y)dy=1.  
\end{equation}

To compute the probability mass $\mbox{P}(y=0)=1-\mbox{P}(y>0)$ and
the density function $f_+(y)$ we must first establish the joint
density function of the latent variables entering the hurdle model.

For trivariate hurdle models, the joint density function of latent
variables $y_1^*$, $y_2^*$ and $y_3^*$ can be derived from the density
function \@ref(eq:trivdens) of variables $z_1$, $z_2$ and $z_3$
by means of the change of variables:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:threez)
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
   z_1  =  y_1^* - \beta_1^\top x_1 \\
   z_2  =  (T(y_2^*) - \beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma \\
   z_3  =  y_3^* - \beta_3^\top x_3 \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

which leads to:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:threedens)
  f(y_1^*, y_2^*, y_3^*)=\frac{T^{'}(y_2^*)}{\sigma}
  \frac{\phi\left(y_1^* - \beta_1^\top x_1, (T(y_2^*)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma,
  y_3^* - \beta_3^\top x_3;\rho \right)}{\Pi},
\end{equation}

where $T^{'}(y_2^*)$ stands for the derivative of $T(y_2^*)$.

To compute $\mbox{P}(y>0)$, we integrate this density function over
the three-dimensional positive octant using the change of variables
\@ref(eq:threez) and the symmetry property of density function
\@ref(eq:trivdens). Performing this integration for a strictly
increasing transformation $T(\cdot)$^[For a strictly decreasing
transformation, as it is the case for some transformations of the
Box-Cox family, the integration with respect to $z_2$ must be
performed by reversing the direction of integration, from
$(T(0)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma$ to $B_1$. By applying the theorem on
the inversion of the integration limits of a definite integral, we
obtain a closed form of the integral similar to that of formula
\@ref(eq:pzero) with truncation value $B_2$ replaced by $B_1$.], which
is the case for the identity and logarithmic transformations we focus
in this paper, and $z_2$ truncated over the interval $[B_1,B_2]$ leads
to:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzero)
\begin{array}{l} \mbox{P}(y>0) =
{\displaystyle \int_{-\beta_1^\top x_1}^\infty
\int_{\frac{T(0)-\beta_2^\top x_2}{\sigma}}^{B_2} \int_{-\beta_3^\top
x_3}^\infty \frac{\phi(z_1,z_2,z_3;\rho)}{\Pi} dz_1 dz_2 dz_3}\\[16pt]
\phantom{\mbox{P}(y>0)} ={\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\beta_1^\top
x_1} \int_{-B_2}^{\frac{\beta_2^\top x_2 -T(0)}{\sigma}}
\int_{-\infty}^{\beta_3^\top x_3} \frac{\phi(z_1,z_2,z_3;\rho)}{\Pi}
dz_1 dz_2 dz_3}\\[16pt] \phantom{\mbox{P}(y>0)} ={\displaystyle
\frac{\Phi(\beta_1^\top x_1,(\beta_2^\top x_2-T(0))/\sigma,
\beta_3^\top x_3;\rho)-\Phi(\beta_1^\top x_1,-B_2,\beta_3^\top
x_3;\rho)}{\Pi}}.
\end{array} 
\end{equation}

Therefore, for $z_2$ left-truncated at $B_1=-\beta_2^\top x_2/\sigma$,
which is the case for the truncated normal distribution
\@ref(eq:trunc), this closed form for $\mbox{P}(y>0)$ simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzero2)
\begin{array}{l} 
\mbox{P}(y>0) =
{\displaystyle \frac{\Phi(\beta_1^\top x_1,(\beta_2^\top
x_2-T(0))/\sigma, \beta_3^\top x_3;\rho)}{\Phi(\beta_2^\top
x_2/\sigma)}}, 
\end{array} 
\end{equation} 

while for the un-truncated normal and the translated (inverse)
log-normal distribution \@ref(eq:lognorm2i) it is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzero3)
\begin{array}{l} 
\mbox{P}(y>0) = \Phi(\beta_1^\top x_1,(\beta_2^\top
x_2-T(0))/\sigma,\beta_3^\top x_3;\rho).  
\end{array} 
\end{equation}

To compute the density function $f_+(y)$ we first derive the joint
density function of variables $y_1^*$, $y$ and $y_3^*$ by performing
the change of variable $y_2^*=\Phi_3 y$ with $\Phi_3=\Phi(\beta_3^\top
x_3)=\mbox{P}(I_3=1)$ on the joint density function
\@ref(eq:threedens), which leads to :

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:denstriv)
  f(y_1^*, y, y_3^*)=\frac{\Phi_3 T^{'}(\Phi_3 y)}{\sigma}
  \frac{\phi\left(y_1^* - \beta_1^\top x_1, (T(\Phi_3 y)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma,
  y_3^* - \beta_3^\top x_3;\rho\right)}{\Pi}.
\end{equation}

We must then integrate this transformed density function over the
positive quadrant of the bi-dimensional support of variables $y_1^*$
and $y_3^*$. To this purpose we rewrite this trivariate normal density
function as the product of the marginal density function of $y$,
written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mdensy)
    f(y)=\frac{\Phi_3 T^{'}(\Phi_3 y)}{\sigma}
    \frac{\phi\left((T(\Phi_3 y)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma\right)}{\Pi},
\end{equation}

and of the conditional joint density function $f(y_1^*,y_3^*|y)$,
which is bivariate normal with expectations, standard-deviations and
correlation coefficient written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:paramdist)
 \begin{array}{l}
  {\displaystyle \mu_{i|2}(y)=\beta_i^\top x_i+\rho_{i2}(T(\Phi_3 y)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma, \quad
  \sigma_{i|2}=\sqrt{1-\rho_{i2}^2}, \quad i=1,3} \\[6pt]
  {\displaystyle\rho_{13|2}=\frac{\rho_{13}-\rho_{12}\rho_{23}}{\sqrt{1-\rho_{12}^2}\sqrt{1-\rho_{23}^2}}}.
 \end{array}
\end{equation}

Integrating this factorization of density function \@ref(eq:denstriv)
with respect to positive values of $y_1^*$ and $y_3^*$ leads to the
following closed form for $f_+(y)$:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:denspos)
\begin{array}{l}
 f_+(y)=f(y)\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty f(y_1^*,y_3^*|y) dy_1^*dy_3^*
 \\ [6pt] \phantom{f_+(y)}=f(y){\displaystyle
 \int_{-\frac{\mu_{1|2}(y)}{\sigma_{1|2}}}^\infty
 \int_{-\frac{\mu_{3|2}(y)}{\sigma_{3|2}}}^\infty
 \phi\left(z_1,z_3;\rho_{13|2}\right) dz_1 dz_3}\\ [16pt]
 \phantom{f_+(y)}=f(y){\displaystyle\Phi\left(\frac{\mu_{1|2}(y)}{\sigma_{1|2}},\frac{\mu_{3|2}(y)}{\sigma_{3|2}};\rho_{13|2}\right)}.
 \end{array} 
 \end{equation}

The probability distribution of the observed censored variable $y$ for
bivariate and univariate hurdle models can be derived from that of the
trivariate model by eliminating hurdles 1, 3 and 1 and 3, respectively.
By eliminating hurdle 1 we obtain:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzerosm1)
\mbox{P}(y>0) = {\displaystyle
    \frac{\Phi\left((\beta_2^\top x_2 - T(0))/\sigma, \beta_3^\top
    x_3;\rho_{23}\right)-\Phi\left(-B_2,\beta_3^\top
    x_3;\rho_{23}\right)}{\Pi}} 
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:densposm1)
f_+(y)=\frac{\Phi_3 T^{'}(\Phi_3
    y)}{\sigma}\frac{\phi\left((T(\Phi_3 y)-\beta_2^\top
    x_2)/\sigma\right)}{\Pi}
    {\displaystyle\Phi\left(\frac{\mu_{3|2}(y)}{\sigma_{3|2}}\right)},
\end{equation}

while the elimination of hurdle 3 leads to:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzerom3)
\mbox{P}(y>0) = {\displaystyle
  \frac{\Phi\left(\beta_1^\top x_1,(\beta_2^\top x_2 -
  T(0))/\sigma;\rho_{12}\right) -\Phi\left(\beta_1^\top
  x_1,-B_2;\rho_{12}\right)}{\Pi}} 
\end{equation}
  
and

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:densposm3)
    f_+(y)=\frac{ T^{'}(y)}{\sigma}\frac{\phi\left((T(y)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma\right)}{\Pi}
    {\displaystyle\Phi\left(\frac{\mu_{1|2}(y)}{\sigma_{1|2}}\right)}.
\end{equation}

Finally, removing both hurdles 1 and 3 leads to the univariate
censured regression model with:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:pzerom13)
\mbox{P}(y>0) = {\displaystyle
  \frac{\Phi\left((\beta_2^\top x_2 -
  T(0))/\sigma\right)-\Phi\left(-B_2\right)} {\Pi}} 
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:densposm13)
    f_+(y)={\displaystyle \frac{ T^{'}(y)}{\sigma}\frac{\phi\left((T(y)-\beta_2^\top x_2)/\sigma\right)}{\Pi}}.
\end{equation}

The econometric framework described in the previous section provides a
theoretical background for tackling the problems of model estimation,
evaluation, selection and prediction within the statistical theory of
classical inference.  In `mhurdle` these statistical issues are
tackled by assuming that data at hand are those observed on a sample
of individuals selected in a large population using a sampling design
generating a data base having the features of a random sample.  ^[Data
provided by surveys conducted by official statistical offices usually
fulfill such requirement, at least as far as the survey is performed
according to a random sampling design where no one of the modeled
dependent variables was used to design the sampling scheme.  On this
important issue see Chapter 24 of @CAME:TRIV:05.]

To appraise the results of a model estimation two fundamental principles
should be used, namely its economic relevance and its statistical
and predictive adequacy. The first principle deals with the issues of
accordance of model estimate with the economic rationale underlying
the model specification and of its relevance for answering the
questions for which the model has been built. These issues are
essentially context specific and, therefore, cannot be dealt with by
means of generic criteria.  The second principle refers to the issues
of empirical soundness of an estimated model and of its ability to predict
sample or out-of-sample observations.  These issues can be tackled by
means of measures of goodness of fit, by formal tests of significance
based on the distribution of model parameter estimators, and by the
quality of predictions provided by an estimated model, respectively.

# Likelihood function

The full parametric specification of our multiple hurdle models allows
to efficiently estimate their parameters by means of the maximum
likelihood principle. Indeed, it is well known from classical
estimation theory that, under the assumption of a correct model
specification and for a likelihood function sufficiently well behaved,
the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient within
the class of consistent and asymptotically normal estimators ^[See
@AMEM/85 chapter 4, for a rigorous statement of this property.].

For a random sample of $n$ observations of the censored dependent
variable $y$ it is easy to derive its likelihood function from the
results set out in previous section 2.2.  As these observations are
all independently drawn from the same conditional (on covariates
$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ and $x_4$) discrete-continuous distribution, which
assigns a conditional probability mass $\mbox{P}(y=0)$ to the observed
value $y=0$ and a conditional density function $f_+(y)$ to the
observed values $y>0$, the log-likelihood function for an observation
$y_i$ can be written as :

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq26)
\ln L_i = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \ln \mbox{P}(y_i=0) & \mbox{if} \quad y_i=0 \\
    \ln f_+(y_i) & \mbox{if} \quad y_i>0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
and the log-likelihood for the entire sample:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq27)
  \ln L = \sum_{i=1}^n \ln L_i= \sum_{i \mid y_i = 0} \ln \mbox{P}(y_i=0) + \sum_{i \mid y_i > 0} \ln f_+(y_i).
\end{equation}

A maximum likelihood estimate of model parameters is obtained by
numerically maximizing this function with respect to all the unknown
model parameters entering this function. Algorithms used in `mhurdle`
to perform this numerical optimization are described later in section
4.2. To the extent that such an estimate is obtained, classical
statistical inference about model parameters $\theta$ under the
assumption of a correctly specified model is performed in `mhurdle`
using the asymptotic approximation of the distribution of maximum
likelihood estimators, which is normal, with expectation $\theta$ and
covariance matrix $(nI_A(\theta))^{-1}$ where $I_A(\theta)$ stands for
the asymptotic Fisher information matrix of a random sample of $n$
observations ^[A more robust approach to classical statistical
inference with respect to model specification errors will be presented
later, in subsection 3.3.].  For empirical applications this
theoretical matrix can be consistently estimated using one of the
following two matrices:

$$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n
\frac{\partial^2\ln
L_i(\hat{\theta})}{\partial\theta\partial\theta^\top} \quad \mbox{or}
\quad \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial\ln L
_i(\hat{\theta})}{\partial\theta}\frac{\partial\ln
L_i(\hat{\theta})}{\partial\theta^\top}$$ 

which limits (for $n\rightarrow\infty$) are called the Hessian and the
gradient versions of $I_A(\theta)$. These matrices are directly
provided by two standard iterative methods used to compute
$\hat{\theta}$, namely the Newton-Raphson and BHHH methods mentioned
in section 4.2.

# Model evaluation and selection using goodness of fit measures

##  Model evaluation and selection using goodness of fit measures

To assess the goodness of fit of a `mhurdle` model estimate we can
not rely on a single measure, as a sample of censored observations of
dependent variable $y$ consists of two sub-samples of incomparable
observations, namely the sub-sample of zero observations and that of
positive observations. The former is a sample of observations of a
qualitative binary variable coding the outcome of the censoring
mechanisms at work, while the latter is a sample of observations of a
quantitative variable measuring the outcome of the demand function,
when this demand is uncensured. As a consequence, a measure of
goodness of fit for each of these two samples of observations must be
used as the goodness of fit is not measured the same way in
qualitative binary response models as in quantitative response models.

To this purpose, we reformulate a `mhurdle` model as a two-part
model.  The first-part specifies a model for the censoring mechanism
explaining the outcome of the qualitative binary variable:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq28)
 d = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    0 & \mbox{if} \quad y=0 \\
    1 & \mbox{if} \quad y>0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

according to a probit model assigning the probability $\mbox{P}(y=0)$
to the censored observation ($d=0$) and the probability
$\mbox{P}(y>0)=1-\mbox{P}(y=0)$ to the uncensored observation
($d=1$). Therefore, the log-likelihood for this first-part model is
written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:29)
  \ln L_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n [(1-d_i) \ln \mbox{P}(y_i=0) + d_i \ln \mbox{P}(y_i>0)].
\end{equation}

The second-part specifies, conditionally to an uncensored response
being observed, the demand model explaining the outcome of
quantitative variable $y$ according to the following conditional
density function:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq30)
  f(y|y>0)=f_+(y)/\mbox{P}(y>0).
\end{equation}

For this second-part model, the log-likelihood is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq31)
  \ln L_+ = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i [\ln f_+(y) - \ln \mbox{P}(y_i>0)].
\end{equation}

Adding-up the log-likelihoods of these two-part model leads to:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq32)
\begin{array}{l}
  \ln L_0 + \ln L_+ = \sum_{i=1}^n [(1-d_i) \ln \mbox{P}(y_i=0) + d_i \ln f_+(y)] \\[4pt]
  \phantom{\ln L_0 + \ln L_+} = \sum_{i \mid y_i = 0} \ln \mbox{P}(y_i=0) + \sum_{i \mid y_i > 0} \ln f_+(y_i)=\ln L,
\end{array}
\end{equation}

meaning that the two-part model is entirely consistent with an
integrated specification of `mhurdle` model.

To develop a measure of fit for binary response models which may be
intuitively interpreted in a similar way to the coefficient of
determination $R^2$ in the linear regression model, @ESTR:98 suggests
to rely on the relationship between $R^2$ and the classical
likelihood-based test statistics, namely the likelihood ratio (LR),
Wald (W) and Lagrange multiplier/score (LM) statistics.  In the normal
linear regression model, where such relationships holds exactly for
the likelihood ratio statistics^[For the Wald and Lagrange multiplier
statistics such relationships holds only locally, in a neighborhood of
the maintained hypothesis of an intercept-only model, and takes
another functional form.], it is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq33)
R^2 = 1-\exp \{-A\} \end{equation} 

with $A=-(2/n)\ln(L_c/L_u)$ the average value of the likelihood ratio
statistic, $L_u$ the maximum value of the unconstrained likelihood,
and $L_c$ the maximum value of the likelihood constrained by the
hypothesis of a model without covariates (intercept-only model).

From this relationships, it follows that $R^2=0$ for $A=0$, which
corresponds to the case where the fit of the unconstrained model is
identical to that of the constrained model (worst fit), and $R^2=1$
when $A=\infty$, the upper bound of the likelihood ratio statistic
achieved when the fit of the unconstrained model is perfect (best
fit). Between these two limits $R^2$ increases with $A$ according to a
rescaling of $A$ determined by a differential equation written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq34)
 dR^2/(1-R^2) = dA.
\end{equation}

These properties of relationships \@ref(eq:eq33) were adopted by
@ESTR:98 as a set of requirements for developing a $R^2$
analog of the measure of fit for a binary response model. Taking into
account that, contrary to the case of a normal linear regression
model, for a binary response model the average likelihood ratio
statistic $A$ varies between 0 (when $L_u=L_c$) and an upper finite
bound $B=-(2/n)\ln L_c$ (when $L_u=1$), a $R^2$ analog for a binary
response model is obtained by solving the differential equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq35)
 dR^2/(1-R^2) = dA/(1-A/B)
\end{equation}

with the initial condition $R^2(0)=0$. This solution:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq36)
 R^2 = 1-(1-A/B)^B
\end{equation}

provides a rescaling of the likelihood ratio statistic for the binary
response model that satisfies the condition $R^2(B)=1$ and converge
towards the rescaling \@ref(eq:eq33) when $B\rightarrow\infty$.

To conclude, for assessing the goodness of fit of the two parts of a
`mhurdle` model we shall use the following $R^2$-rescaling of
likelihoods $L_0$ and $L_+$:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq37)
 R_0^2 = 1-(\ln L_{0c}/\ln L_{0u})^{(2/n)\ln L_{0c}} \quad \mbox{and} \quad  R_+^2 = 1-(L_{+c}/L_{+u})^{2/n_+}
\end{equation}
with $n_+=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i$ the sample size of uncensored observations.

Note that the estimation of an intercept-only `mhurdle` model is not
generally possible in its original parametrization because in the
absence of covariates many parameters are under-identified, and thus
cannot be consistently estimated. To compute the maximum values of the
constrained likelihoods $L_{0c}$ and $L_{+c}$, we must respecify the
probability distribution of dependent variable $y$ by means of
identifiable parameters. To this end we observe from formula
\@ref(eq:pzero) that $\mbox{P}(y>0)$ is a constant $P_+$, and from
formula \@ref(eq:denspos) that $f_+(y)$ is proportional to the density
function of $T(y)$ which is normal with a constant expectation $\mu$
and a constant variance $s^2$. Hence, the log-likelihood of the
constrained first-part model is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq29a)
   \ln L_{0c}=n_+ \ln (1-P_+) + n_+ \ln P_+,
\end{equation}

and provides the following maximum likelihood estimator for $P_+$:
$\hat{P}_+=n_+/n$.  Similarly, the log-likelihood of the constrained
second-part model is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq31a)
  \ln L_{+c} = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i \ln \phi\left(\frac{T(y_i)-\mu}{s}\right) - n_+ \ln (sP_+).
\end{equation}

leading to the following estimators for parameters $\mu$ and $s^2$:
$\hat{\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i T(y_i)/n_+$ and $\hat{s}^2=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i (T(y_i)-\hat{\mu})^2/n_+$.

The maximized values of constrained likelihoods $L_{0c}$ and $L_{+c}$
are obtained by inserting these estimators for parameters $P_+$, $\mu$
and $s^2$ into formulas \@ref(eq:eq29a) and \@ref(eq:eq31a).  Note that
for the logarithmic transformation \@ref(eq:lognorm2) with a non-zero
location parameter $\alpha$, the constrained log-likelihood
\@ref(eq:eq31a) must also be maximized with respect to this
parameter. This maximization may be performed effectively by
considering $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{s}^2$ as functions of $\alpha$, and
maximizing the concentrated log-likelihood obtained by inserting these
conditional estimators into constrained log-likelihood \@ref(eq:eq31a),
which becomes a function of the single parameter $\alpha$ written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq31b)
  \ln \max_{\mu,\sigma^2}L_{+c} = -\frac{n_+}{2}\left[1+\ln\left(2\pi \frac{n_+}{n}\right)+\ln\hat{s}^2(\alpha)\right].
\end{equation}

Goodness of fit measures \@ref(eq:eq37) can also be used for model
selection, a decision problem dealing with the identification, among
several model specifications used to explain the same dependent
variable, of the one that is best suited to explain the sample of
available observations. From this point of view, goodness of fit
measures \@ref(eq:eq37) allow to identify the model specification
achieving the best in-sample fit.  To be fair, the goodness of fit
measure used for model selection must account for differences in the
degree of model parametrization. Indeed, the value of the above
goodness of fit measures can be improved by increasing model
parametrization, because model estimation is performed by maximizing
the model likelihood function from which functionally depend the
goodness of fit measures we consider. Consequently, a penalty that
increases with the number of model parameters should be added to
formulas \@ref(eq:eq37).  To this purpose, we shall rely on
THEIL(1971)'s correction of the coefficient of determination in the
linear regression model. This leads to the following adjusted
$R^2$-rescaling of likelihoods $L_0$ and $L_+$:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq37a) 
\bar{R}_0^2 = 1-\frac{n-1}{n-K}(\ln
L_{0c}/\ln L_{0u})^{(2/n)\ln L_{0c}} \quad \mbox{and} \quad
\bar{R}_+^2 = 1-\frac{n-K_0}{n-K}(L_{+c}/L_{+u})^{2/n_+}
\end{equation}

with $K$ and $K_0$ the number of parameters in the
unconstrained model and the number of parameters in the constrained
second-part model, respectively.  Such adjustments may not be relevant
in large samples but may be relevant in small samples.

## Model selection using Vuong tests

Model evaluation can also be tackled from the point of view of the
model specification that is favored in a formal test comparing two
model alternatives.

This second model selection criterion relies on the use of a test
proposed by @VUONG/89. According to the rationale of this test, the
"best" parametric model specification among a collection of competing
specifications is the one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler
Information Criterion (KLIC), namely a measure of the distance between
the conditional probability mass/density function^[For mhurdle models,
this conditional probability function is written as :
$$f(y|x)=\mbox{P}(y=0|x)^{1-d}f_+(y|x)^d,$$ with $d$ defined by
formula \@ref(eq:eq28).]  $f(y|x;\theta)$ of a possibly misspecified
parametric model and that of the true unknown model denoted by
$h(y|x)$, defined by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq38) 
KLIC=E\left[\ln
\left(\frac{h(y|x)}{f(y|x;\theta_\ast)}\right)\right]=\int \ln
\left(\frac{h(y|x)}{f(y|x;\theta_\ast)}\right)dH(y,x), 
\end{equation}

where $H(y,x)$ denotes the distribution function of the true joint
distribution of $(y,x)$ and $\theta_\ast$ the probability limit, with
respect to $H(y,x)$, of the so called quasi-maximum likelihood
estimator $\hat{\theta}$ obtained by applying the maximum likelihood
method when $f(y|x;\theta)$ is misspecified. Note that KLIC criterion
takes a minimum value of 0 when there is a value $\theta_0$ of
parameter vector $\theta$ such that $f(y|x;\theta_0)=h(y|x)$ almost
everywhere^[By "almost everywhere" we mean: for all points of the
support of the true distribution of $(y,x)$ except those for which the
probability $\mbox{P}_H[(y,x): f(y|x;\theta_0)\neq h(y|x)]=0$.],
meaning that conditional probability function $f(y|x;\theta)$ is
correctly specified. At the opposite, KLIC will take large values when
$f(y|x;\theta)$ very poorly specifies the true conditional probability
function $h(y|x)$.

As the application of this model selection criterion equals selecting
the model specification for which the quantity:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq39)
E[\ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)]=\int \ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)dH(y,x)
\end{equation}

is the largest, given two competing models with conditional
probability functions $f(y|x;\theta)$ and $g(y|x;\pi)$ and parameter
vectors $\theta$ and $\pi$ of size $K$ and $L$, respectively, Vuong
suggests to discriminate between these models by testing the null
hypothesis:

$$
H_0 : E[\ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)]=E[\ln g(y|x;\pi_\ast)]
\Longleftrightarrow
E\left[\ln\frac{f(y|x;\theta_\ast)}{g(y|x;\pi_\ast)}\right]=0,
$$

meaning that the two models are equivalent, against either:

$$
H_f : E[\ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)]>E[\ln g(y|x;\pi_\ast)]
\Longleftrightarrow
E\left[\ln\frac{f(y|x;\theta_\ast)}{g(y|x;\pi_\ast)}\right]>0,
$$

meaning that specification $f(y|x;\theta)$ is better than
$g(y|x;\pi)$, or:

$$
H_g : E[\ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)]<E[\ln g(y|x;\pi_\ast)]
\Longleftrightarrow
E\left[\ln\frac{f(y|x;\theta_\ast)}{g(y|x;\pi_\ast)}\right]<0,
$$

meaning that specification $g(y|x;\pi)$ is better than $f(y|x;\theta)$.

The quantity $E[\ln f(y|x;\theta_\ast)]$ is unknown but it can be
consistently estimated, under some regularity conditions, by $1/n$
times the log-likelihood evaluated at the quasi-maximum likelihood
estimator for $\theta$. Hence, $1/n$ times the log-likelihood ratio
statistic: 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq40)
LR(\hat{\theta},\hat{\pi})=\sum_{i=1}^n
\ln\frac{f(y_i|x_i;\hat{\theta})}{g(y_i|x_i;\hat{\pi})} 
\end{equation}

is a consistent estimator for
$E\left[\ln(f(y|x;\theta_\ast)/g(y|x;\pi_\ast))\right]$.

Therefore, an obvious test of $H_0$ consists in verifying whether a
$LR$-based statistic differs from zero. The distribution of such a
statistic can be worked out even when the true model is unknown, as the
quasi-maximum likelihood estimators $\hat{\theta}$ and $\hat{\pi}$
converge in probability to the pseudo-true values $\theta_\ast$ and
$\pi_\ast$, respectively, and have asymptotic normal distributions
centered on these pseudo-true values.

In his seminal paper @VUONG/89 suggests to use different LR-based
statistic according to the relation linking the two competing models,
which may be nested, strictly non-nested or overlapping models ^[These
classical Vuong tests have been programmed in our former version of
`mhurdle` presented in Carlevaro et al. (2012).].

In a recent paper @SHI:15 has criticized Vuong testing procedures for
discriminating between competing models by showing that they can
generate severe size distortions in finite samples. She develops a new
test statistic that corrects these size distortions and which
universally applies to nested, strictly non-nested and overlapping
models. The rationale of Shi test statistic consists in correcting two
finite sample size distortions present in the test statistic used by
Vuong to discriminate two strictly non-nested models, namely:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq41)
T_{LR}=\frac{LR(\hat{\theta}, \hat{\pi})/\sqrt{n}}{\hat{\omega}},
\end{equation}

with $\hat{\omega}^2$ a sample analogue consistent estimator of the
variance of the asymptotic distribution of the numerator of statistic
$T_{LR}$, which is $N(0,\omega^2)$ under the null hypothesis $H_0$.

The first size distortion is due to a bias of order $O(1/n)$ present
in the expectation of the asymptotic distribution of the numerator of
$T_{LR}$ under $H_0$. This expectation is written as $-tr(V)/(2n)$
with $tr(V)=tr(A_F^{-1}B_F)-tr(A_G^{-1}B_G)$, where $A_F$ and $B_F$
are the limits of the Hessian and of the gradient version of the
Fisher information matrix of model $F_\theta$, respectively, and $A_G$
and $B_G$ those of model $G_\pi$. Therefore, for a model for which the
information identity $A+B=O$ holds $\delta=-tr(A^{-1}B)=tr(I)$ is
equal to the number of model parameters.  This suggests to consider
$\delta$ as a measure of the degree of model parametrization which
increases with the number of model parameters and with the discrepancy
of the information identity resulting from the nonlinearity of the
model with respect to its parameters.  As a consequence, the finite
sample bias of statistic $LR(\hat{\theta},\hat{\pi})/n$ is given by
$(-\delta_F+\delta_G)/(2n)$. It will be negligible for models of
similar degrees of parametrization but negative and of possibly
significant magnitude when model $F_\theta$ is more heavily and
non-linearly parameterized than model $G_\pi$. Hence, in order to
avoid an over-rejection of $H_0$ in favor of the more parameterized
model, Shi suggests to correct the Vuong statistic $T_{LR}$ by
subtracting to $LR(\hat{\theta}, \hat{\pi})$ a consistent estimator of
its asymptotic bias under $H_0$, namely $-tr(\hat{V})/2$ with
$\hat{V}$ a consistent estimator of matrix $V$.

The second adjustment of Vuong statistic $T_{LR}$ suggested by Shi is
intended to prevent the denominator $\hat{\omega}$ of this statistic
from taking values close to zero with non negligible probability, which
contributes to create a fat tail for the distribution of $T_{LR}$. This
adjustment consists in adding a positive constant term to $\hat{\omega}^2$,
written as $c\mbox{tr}(\hat{V}^2/n)$ with $c$ a positive constant
chosen according to a data-dependent method
^[Except for nested models, where $c$ is set equal to zero],
in order to avoid large values of $T_{LR}$ when its denominator is
close to zero while its numerator is not.

Finally the modified Vuong test by Shi, called by her a \emph{non-degenerate
Vuong test}, uses the following statistic:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq42)
T_{LR}^{mod}=\frac{(LR(\hat{\theta}, \hat{\pi})+\mbox{tr}(\hat{V})/2)/\sqrt{n}}
{\sqrt{\hat{\omega}^2+c \mbox{tr}(\hat{V}^2)/n}}.
\end{equation}

To completely remove the asymptotic size distortion, Shi proposes to
compute a simulated critical value $\mbox{cv}(a)$, which has a well
controlled asymptotic size, in the sense that, asymptotically and for
any $c\geq0$, the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is true is
upper bounded by $a$ ^[For a two sided test this size is
$P[|T_{LR}^{mod}|>\mbox{cv}(a)|H_0]$, and for a one sided test
$P[T_{LR}^{mod}>\mbox{cv}(a)|H_0]$.].  By systematically changing the
value of $a$ in order to equalize the simulated critical value
$\mbox{cv}(a)$ to the observed value of statistic $T_{LR}^{mod}$, it
is possible to derive a simulated p-value allowing to perform a
non-degenerate Vuong test at any controlled asymptotic size level.

For non-nested models the test is two sided. It is carried out by
rejecting $H_0$ if the simulated p-value is less than the selected
size level $a$, and in favor of either $H_f$ if $T_{LR}^{mod}>0$, or
of $H_g$ if $T_{LR}^{mod}<0$.

For nested models the test is one sided because the nested model
cannot be closer to the true unknown model than the nesting model
according to the KLIC criterion.  Supposing without loss of generality
that model $G_\pi$ is nested into model $F_\theta$, the test is
carried out by rejecting $H_0$ in favor of $H_f$ if the simulated
p-value is less than the selected size level $a$. Note that this test
is a robust alternative to the usual LR-test for testing the
statistical significance of a priori restrictions on the parameters of
model $F_\theta$, in the sense that it allows the unrestricted model
to be misspecified.

A last comment deserves to be devoted to the choice of the size
$\alpha$ of the test, which measures the probability of rejecting
$H_0$ when it is true, and thus the risk of favoring, on grounds of
statistical evidence, the use of one of two competing models while
they are equivalent. This choice is routinely made by assuming a low
value of $\alpha$ (5\% or 1\%) without referring to the operational
meaning of the test result. But in a decision-making framework of
selection between two models, the size of the test can be chosen as
large as desired because if the two models are equivalent it is
irrelevant to use one or the other of these two models. On the other
end, the risk of the second kind, namely the probability of rejecting
either $H_f$ or $H_g$ when one of these two models is true, must be
minimized, because concluding that the two models are equivalent does
not allow deciding which one of them should be used. Not rejecting
$H_0$ simply point out that further sample information is needed to
determine, with the desired degree of certainty, which of the two
model alternatives is the more suitable for the intended uses.

But how to proceed if further data-gathering is impossible, which is
the typical situation faced in econometric studies. In this situation
the discrimination test between two models must be reformulated as a
@SIMO:43 symmetric test, namely a binary choice between models
$F_{\theta}$ and $G_{\pi}$ where none of these models is privileged as
a null hypothesis of a classical asymmetric Neyman-Pearson test. This
reformulation removes the irrelevant hypothesis of doubt $H_0$ from
the decision-making framework by forcing the test to always conclude
in favor of one of the two confronted models, which seems appropriate
when there is no a priori evidence to consider one of the two models
more plausible than the other^[The assumption of a Bayesian
probability of one half for the plausibility a priori of both
confronted models may not be appropriate in the case of two nested
models, where one is a special case of the other, and thus the former
less plausible than the latter. For these models, an asymmetric
Neyman-Person test where the restricted model represents the null
hypothesis and the unrestricted model the alternative hypothesis seems
more appropriate, in particular when the model parameters on which
restrictions are tested have an economic meaning.].  The test is
carried out by first computing the value of statistic $T_{LR}$ or
$T_{LR}^{mod}$, then by rejecting model $G_{\pi}$ in favor of model
$F_{\theta}$ when this value is positive, and conversely by rejecting
$F_{\theta}$ in favor of $G_{\pi}$ when the value is negative ^[For
nested models, Simon's approach always leads to favor the nesting
(unrestricted) model to the nested (restricted) one.].  The
probability of committing an error with this symmetric test (accepting
model $F_{\theta}$ when it is worse than $G_{\pi}$) ^[There is no need
to distinguish between error of the first and second kind, since an
error of the first kind for testing $H_f$ against $H_g$ (rejecting
model $F_{\theta}$ when it is better than model $G_{\pi}$) is an error
of the second kind for testing $H_g$ against $H_f$ (accepting model
$G_{\pi}$ when it is worse than $F_{\theta}$), and vice versa.]  is a
function of $D=E\left[\ln(f(y|x;\theta_\ast)/g(y|x;\pi_\ast))\right]$,
since the tested hypothesis is a composite one leaving unspecified the
absolute value of the distance $D$ between the distributions of models
$F_{\theta}$ and $G_{\pi}$.  This risk is maximum for $D=0$ and
decreases with $|D|$. The exact value of this risk can be found by
integrating the density function of statistics $T_{LR}$ or
$T_{LR}^{mod}$ over its negative values^[For the Vuong statistic
$T_{LR}$ this distribution for testing $H_f$ against $H_g$ is $N(D,1)$
with $D\geq0$. Hence, the risk of rejecting model $F_{\theta}$ when it
is better than model $G_{\pi}$ is equal to
$\mbox{P}(N(0,1)<-D)=\Phi(-D)$. This probability decreases from 1/2 to
0 when $D$ increases from 0 to $\infty$.].

## Prediction and marginal effects

Prediction with a causal model like `mhurdle` of an observable
dependent random variable $z$ refers to defining a function of model
covariates $x$ providing, for any admissible value of $x$, a point
estimate $\hat{z}$ of $z$ whose prediction error $e=z-\hat{z}$ is
minimized according to some criterion.  In the frame of classical or
frequentist statistical inference paradigm, an optimal conditional
predictor of $z$, for a given value of covariates $x$, is defined as
the one that minimizes the expectation of the squared conditional
prediction error, namely $E[e^2|x]$ called the mean-square error of
prediction. Using this criterion leads to select as optimal predictor
for $z$ its conditional expectation $E[z|x]$, called the best
mean-square error predictor for $z$.

As defined by identity \@ref(eq:expcons), the dependent observable
variable $y$ of `mhurdle` is a mixture of a fqualitative and a
quantitative variables whose expectation has no actual meaning, the
zero-value of $y$ denoting the numerical value taken by the binary
dummy variable $d$ when the observation of latent variable $y_2^*$ is
censored. Therefore, for a predictive purpose, one must disentangle
the qualitative component of $y$ from its purely quantitative
component. This can be done by solving the prediction problem of $y$
in the framework of the two-part respecification of `mhurdle` models
presented in section 3.2.

The first-part of this model explains the outcome of the qualitative
component of $y$ using the binary variable $d$, whose best mean-square
error predictor is given by:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq47)
E[d|x]=0\times \mbox{P}(y=0)+ 1\times\mbox{P}(y>0)=\mbox{P}(y>0),
\end{equation}

with $\mbox{P}(y>0)$ specified by formulas \@ref(eq:pzero),
\@ref(eq:pzero2), \@ref(eq:pzero3), \@ref(eq:pzerosm1), \@ref(eq:pzerom3) and
\@ref(eq:pzerom13).

The second-part of the model explains the outcome of the quantitative
component of $y$ taking positive real values according to the density
function \@ref(eq:eq30). Accordingly, the best mean-square error
predictor of $y>0$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq48)
E[y|y>0,x]=\int_0^\infty y \frac{f_+(y)}{\mbox{P}(y>0)}dy=\frac{E[y|x]}{\mbox{P}(y>0)},
\end{equation}

with $f_+(y)$ specified by formulas \@ref(eq:denspos),
\@ref(eq:densposm1), \@ref(eq:densposm3) and \@ref(eq:densposm13).

For the special cases of transformations $T(\cdot)$ identity and
logarithmic focused in this paper, closed analytical forms for
$E[y|x]$ can be established^[Proofs for the analytical forms
\@ref(eq:eq49) and \@ref(eq:eq53) are available from the authors.].

For the identity transformation $T(y_2^*)=y_2^*$, this analytical
closed form for trivariate hurdle models with density function
$f_+(y)$ specified by formula \@ref(eq:denspos) is written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq49)
E[y|x]=\frac{\Phi_{123}}{\Phi_3}\beta_2^\top x_2 + \frac{\sigma}{\Phi_3}\left( \phi_2\Phi_{13\mid 2}
+\rho_{12}\phi_1\Phi_{23\mid 1} +\rho_{23}\phi_3\Phi_{12\mid 3}\right),
\end{equation}

where

$$
 \begin{array}{l}
  {\displaystyle \Phi_{123}=\Phi\left(\beta_1^\top x_1, \frac{\beta_2^\top x_2}{\sigma}, \beta_3^\top x_3;\rho\right),
   \quad \phi_i=\phi(\beta_i^\top x_i), \quad i=1,3 , \quad \phi_2=\phi\left(\frac{\beta_2^\top x_2}{\sigma}\right), } \\[6pt]
  {\displaystyle \Phi_{ij\mid k} = \Phi\left(\frac{\mu_{i|k}}{\sigma_{i|k}},\frac{\mu_{j|k}}{\sigma_{j|k}};\rho_{ij|k}\right),
  \quad i\neq j\neq k,\quad \mu_{i|k}=\beta_i^\top x_i-\rho_{ik}\beta_k^\top x_k, \quad k=1,3 ,} \\[6pt]
  {\displaystyle \quad \mu_{i|2}=\beta_i^\top x_i-\rho_{i2}\frac{\beta_2^\top x_2}{\sigma},
  \quad \sigma_{i|k}=\sqrt{1-\rho_{ik}^2}, \quad \rho_{ij|k}=\frac{\rho_{ij}-\rho_{ik}\rho_{jk}}{\sigma_{i|k}\sigma_{j|k}}.}
 \end{array}
$$

The closed forms for bivariate and univariate hurdle models with
density function $f_+(y)$ specified by formulas \@ref(eq:densposm1),
\@ref(eq:densposm3) and \@ref(eq:densposm13), are written as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq50)
E[y|x]=\frac{\Phi_{23}}{\Phi_3}\beta_2^\top x_2 + \frac{\sigma}{\Phi_3}\left( \phi_2\Phi_{3\mid 2}
+\rho_{23}\phi_3\Phi_{2\mid 3}\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq51)
E[y|x]=\Phi_{12}\beta_2^\top x_2 + \sigma\left( \phi_2\Phi_{1\mid 2}+\rho_{12}\phi_1\Phi_{2\mid 1}\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq52)
E[y|x]=\Phi_2\beta_2^\top x_2 + \sigma \phi_2,
\end{equation}
respectively.

Similarly, closed analytical forms for $E[y|x]$ can be established in
the case of the logarithmic transformation
$T(y_2^*)=\ln(y_2^*+\alpha)$. For trivariate, bivariate and univariate
hurdle models with density function $f_+(y)$ specified by formulas
\@ref(eq:denspos), \@ref(eq:densposm1), \@ref(eq:densposm3) and \@ref(eq:densposm13) these
closed forms are written, respectively:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq53)
\mbox{E}[y|x] = \frac{e^{\beta_2^\top x_2 +
    \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}}{\Phi_3} \Phi\left(\beta_1^\top x_1 +
  \rho_{12}\sigma, \frac{\beta_2^\top x_2-\ln \alpha}{\sigma} +
  \sigma,\beta_3^\top x_3 + \rho_{23}\sigma ; \rho\right)
-\frac{\alpha}{\Phi_3}\Phi_{123},
\end{equation}

with $\Phi_{123}=\Phi(\beta_1^\top x_1,(\beta_2^\top x_2-\ln
\alpha)/\sigma,\beta_3^\top x_3;\rho)$,

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq54)
\mbox{E}[y|x] = \frac{e^{\beta_2^\top x_2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}}{\Phi_3}
 \Phi\left(\frac{\beta_2^\top x_2-\ln \alpha}{\sigma} + \sigma,\beta_3^\top x_3 + \rho_{23}\sigma;
  \rho_{23}\right)-\frac{\alpha}{\Phi_3}\Phi_{23},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq55)
\mbox{E}[y|x] = \frac{e^{\beta_2^\top x_2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}}{\Phi_3}
 \Phi\left(\beta_1^\top x_1 + \rho_{12}\sigma, \frac{\beta_2^\top x_2-\ln \alpha}{\sigma}+\sigma;\rho_{12}\right)
 -\frac{\alpha}{\Phi_3}\Phi_{12},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:eq56)
\mbox{E}[y|x] = e^{\beta_2^\top x_2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}
 \Phi\left(\frac{\beta_2^\top x_2-\ln \alpha}{\sigma}+\sigma\right)
 -\frac{\alpha}{\Phi_3}\Phi_2.
\end{equation}

The marginal effects we consider refer to the change in the value of
predictors \@ref(eq:eq47) and \@ref(eq:eq48) generated by a ceteris
paribus increase of a model covariate, the value of the other model
covariates being kept unchanged, as in a laboratory experiment.

The definition of the marginal effect of a `mhurdle` covariate $x_0$
on a dependent variable of the model, depends on the scale of measure
of $x_0$.  When $x_0$ is a continuous quantitative variable measured
either on an interval or on a ratio scale,^[A variable is said to be
quantitative when the distance between two states of the variable can
be measured, as for a physical magnitude, using the usual notion of
distance between real numbers. This condition is fulfilled when a unit
of measure, namely the distance between two particular states of the
variable, can be used as a standard to express the distance between
any pair of states as multiples of the unit of measure. This scale of
measurement is said to be a cardinal or interval scale if the origin
of the scale, numerically coded by zero, is arbitrary; it is said to
be a measure or ratio scale if the origin of the scale is unique and
not arbitrary; finally, it is said to be a count scale if its origin
and unit of measure are both unique and not arbitrary.]  the marginal
effect of $x_0$ on predictor \@ref(eq:eq47) or \@ref(eq:eq48) is the
first derivative of the predictor with respect to $x_0$, namely the
rate of change in the value of the predictor generated by a ceteris
paribus infinitesimal increase of $x_0$. Similarly, if $x_0$ is a
count variable measuring the size of a population of individuals or
objects which can only vary by integers, the marginal effect will be
defined as the finite change in the predictor induced by a ceteris
paribus unit increase of $x_0$.

When $x_0$ is a qualitative explanatory variable that can be in one
and only one of $K\geq2$ different mutually exclusive and exhaustive
situations called attributes, it is usual to code it as a column
vector of $K$ dummy variables $x_0=[d_k]_{k=1,...,K}$, taking values
$d_h=1$ and $d_k=0,\forall k\neq h$ when the observed attribute of
$x_0$ is the one indexed by $h$. In this case, considering $x_0$ as
the first (vector) element of one of `mhurdle` covariate vectors $x_i,
i=1,...,4$, the first term of the corresponding linear combination
$\beta_i^\top x_i$ will take the value $\beta_{ih}$.

Yet, this dummy coding of a nominal explanatory variable ^[A
qualitative variable is said to be nominal if its "scale of measure"
allows to determine whether two observed states are equal or
different; it is said to be partially ordered if some of its
attributes may also be ordered; finally, it is said to be ordered if
all its attributes may be ordered.]  has an annoying drawback: because
the $K$ dummy variables are linearly related by the constraint
$\sum_{k=1}^K d_k = 1$, the parameters $\beta_{ik},k=1,...,K$ are not
identified and therefore not estimable when vector $\beta_i$ does
contain an intercept term.  To avoid this inconvenience, it is
suggested to suppress from a $K$-attribute dummy coding one of the $K$
dummies, the discarded attribute playing the role of a "reference
attribute" with respect to which the impact on $\beta_i^\top x_i$ of
one of the $K-1$ remaining attributes is measured. Indeed,
substituting in $\sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{ik} d_k$ dummy variable $d_K$ of
reference attribute $K$ by $d_K=1-\sum_{k=1}^K d_k$, we obtain
$\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} (\beta_{ik}-\beta_{iK})d_k+\beta_{iK}$, showing that
the impact on $\beta_i^\top x_i$ of attribute $k$ is measured by
parameter $b_k=\beta_{ik}-\beta_{iK}$ called contrast with respect to
attribute $K$, while the impact coefficient $\beta_{iK}$ is included
in vector $\beta_i$ as an intercept, or incorporated to an already
existing intercept of this vector.  Consequently, the marginal effect
of a change of $x_0$, from attribute $h$ to attribute $k$, will be
defined as the finite change in the predictor induced by a ceteris
paribus change of the first term of $\beta_i^\top x_i$ from contrast
$b_{ih}$ to contrast $b_{ik}$, with obviously $b_K=0$.

When $x_0$ is a nominal qualitative variable whose $K$ attributes may
be partially or totally ordered according to some meaningful criterion
(for example the educational level measured and ranked according to
the highest level of diploma awarded), it is possible to use a dummy
coding allowing to assess the degree of monotonicity between a ceteris
paribus marginal increment of $x_0$ from one attribute level to the
next higher attribute level, and its impact on the dependent variable
predictor. To this purpose, this impact generated by the marginal
increment of $x_0$ from its attribute of rank $k-1$ to its attribute
of immediately higher rank $k$ must be measured by the following
marginal contrasts: $\gamma_k=\beta_{ik}-\beta_{i,k-1},
k=2,...,K$. Hence, substituting in $\sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{ik} d_k$
parameters $\beta_{ik}$ by the following solution of the former
recurrence equations with respect to $\gamma_k, k=2,...,K$, namely
$\beta_{i1}+\sum_{h=2}^k \gamma_h$ leads to the following recoding of
the $K$-attribute dummy coding in terms of marginal contrasts:
$\beta_{i1}+\sum_{k=2}^K \gamma_k \delta_k$ with
$\delta_k=\sum_{h=k}^K d_h$.  Consequently, the marginal effect of a
change of $x_0$, from pre-ordered attributes $k-1$ to $k$, will be
defined as the finite change in the predictor induced by a ceteris
paribus change of the first term of $\beta_i^\top x_i$ from marginal
contrast $\gamma_{k-1}$ to marginal contrast $\gamma_k$, with
$\gamma_1=0$.

So far, punctual prediction and marginal effects for a `mhurdle`
independent variable have been tackled by assuming known the value of
the model parameters.  However, to be operational these formulas must
be quantified by means of an estimate of these theoretical
parameters. Using the maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}$ of
model parameters $\theta$ presented in section 3.1, provide an implied
maximum likelihood estimator for a column-vector $h(\theta)$ of best
mean-square error predictors \@ref(eq:eq47), \@ref(eq:eq48),
and/or marginal effects of these predictors, namely
$h(\hat{\theta})$. This estimator is, as $\hat{\theta}$, a consistent
and asymptotically normal estimator for $h(\theta)$ whose asymptotic
distribution can be derived from a linearization of $h(\hat{\theta})$
around $\theta$ called the "delta method", which leads to the
following asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of $h(\hat{\theta})$:
$(1/n)(\partial h/\partial\theta^\top) I_A(\theta)^{-1} (\partial
h/\partial\theta^\top)^\top$.

A last comment deserves to be devoted to how to present the estimates
of marginal effects which are representative for the available
sample. To this purpose it is customary to provide either the marginal
effects computed at the sample average value of model covariates, or
the average value of the sample of marginal effects computed at the
model covariates values of the individuals of the sample. The first
solution must be avoided when same model covariates are qualitative,
because the sample average value of a dummy coded qualitative variable
is no more a qualitative variable but a vector of proportions without
a meaningful interpretation for a representative individual.
Regarding the second solution, it provides an informative measure of
location of the marginal distribution of a marginal effect, but that
is not enough to characterize, by itself, the a priori unknown
profileq of this distribution. Accordingly, it should be supplemented
by other indicators allowing to characterize the typical shape of the
distribution, in particular the bounds of the distribution range, the
standard deviation and the three quartiles.

# Software rationale


```{r label = setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, widtht = 65)
options(width = 65)
``` 
To illustrate the use of `mhurdle`, we use one surveys conducted by
the Bureau of Labour Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labour,
called the "Interview Survey". Data from 25813 households on all
expenditures are collected on a quarterly basis. They are reported on
an annual basis, in thousands of USD, and divided by the number of
consumption units^[Obtained by counting for one the first
adult of the household, 0.7 the subsequent adults and 0.5 every other
person aged under 18].  The micro-data files are publicly available on
the website of the Bureau of Labour Statistics, and may be downloaded
and used without permission.  We use a small subset of 1000 randomly
selected households.

```{r eval = TRUE, label = Data}
library("mhurdle")
data("Interview", package = "mhurdle")
```
The covariates are :

-`income`: the anual net income by consumption unit,

-`smsa`: does the household live in a SMSA (`yes` or
    `no`),
	
-`age`: the age of the reference person of the household,

-`educ`: the number of year of education of the reference person of
    the household,
	
-`sex`: the sex of the reference person of the household
    (`male` and `female`),
	
-`size`: the number of persons in the household, 

-`month`: the month of the interview (between 1 and 12),

Among the numerous goods available in this data set, we choose the
"fees and admissions" good (denoted `shows` in the data set),
which is of particulary interest because the three competing hurdles
are a priori relevant to explain censored observations.

```{r }
round(c(mean = mean(Interview$shows),
        "% of 0" = mean(Interview$shows == 0), 
        "mean pos" = mean(Interview$shows) / mean(Interview$shows > 0)),
      2)
``` 

The consumption of this good is highly censored, as only less than a
third of the households in the sample actually purchased it during the
survey. The average consumption is \$120 a year, or \$380 for those
who consumme.


## Estimation

The estimation is performed using the `mhurdle` function, which
has the following arguments:


-`formula`: a formula describing the model to estimate. It should have
  between two and four parts on the right-hand side specifying, in the
  first part, the good selection equation covariates, in the second
  part, the desired consumption equation covariates, in the third
  part, the purchasing equation covariates and in the fourth part, the
  covariates of the variance equation.
  
-`data`: a data frame containing the observations of the variables
  present in the formula.
  
-`subset, weights, na.action`: these are arguments passed on to the
  `model.frame` function in order to extract the data suitable for the
  model. These arguments are present in the `lm` function and in most
  of the estimation functions.
  
-`start`: the starting values, that can be provided by the user, which
  may be necessary for complicated and highly parametric models,
  -`dist`: this argument indicates the functional form of the desired
  consumption equation, which may be either log-normal `"ln"` (the
  default), normal `"n"`, Box-Cox `"bc"`, or inverse Hyperbolic Sine
  `"ihs"`,
  
-`corr`: this boolean argument indicates whether the disturbance of
  the different equations are correlated, the default value is
  `FALSE`,
  
-`h2`: this boolean argument indicates whether the second hurdle is
  effective or not,
  
-`robust`: if `TRUE`, transformations of some parameters are used, so
  that they lie in the required range (positive values for the
  standard deviation and for the position parameter, between -1 and +1
  for the coefficients of correlation),
  
-`...`: further arguments that are passed to the optimisation function
  `maxLik`.


For sake of clarity, we'll denote the estimated models using à 5
digits name. The first one is a capital letter indicating the
distribution used (either `N` for a normal distribution and `L` for a
log-normal distribution), the second, third and fourth ones are 1 if
the first, second and third hurdles are present, 0 if they are not and
the fifth digit is either `D` or `I` if a dependent or an independent
model is estimated.

To illustrate the use of `mhurdle`, we start with single equation
tobit models, using a normal and a log-normal specification.

```{r label = tobit}
N010I <- mhurdle(shows ~ 0 | linc + smsa + age + 
                     educ + size, data = Interview, 
                 h2 = TRUE, dist = "n", method = "bhhh")
L010I <- update(N010I, dist = "ln")
``` 

We then consider the two other potential hurdles, namely the selection
process and the infrequency of purchase. We only keep `linc` as a
covariate for the desired consumption and the other covariates
(`smsa`, `age`, `educ` and `size`) are used either in the first
(selection model) or the third part (infrequency of purchase model) of
the formula. Note that the `dist` argument is not provided (so that
the default log-normal distribution is chosen) and that the lack of
ressource hurdle is either maintained or removed by setting the `h2`
argument respectively to `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r label = selection}
L100D <- mhurdle(shows ~ smsa + age + educ + size | 
                     linc, data = Interview, 
                 h2 = FALSE, dist = "ln", corr = TRUE, method = "bhhh", 
                 finalHessian = TRUE)
L100D2 <- update(L100D, start = coef(L100D), robust = FALSE)
L110D <- update(L100D, h2 = TRUE)
L110D2 <- update(L110D, start = coef(L110D), robust = FALSE)
L001D <- mhurdle(shows ~ 0 | linc | smsa + age +  
                       educ + size, data = Interview, 
                   h2 = FALSE, corr = TRUE, method = "bhhh", 
                 finalHessian = TRUE)
L001D2 <- update(L001D, start = coef(L001D), robust = FALSE)
L011D <- update(L001D, h2 = TRUE)
L011D2 <- update(L011D, start = coef(L011D), robust = FALSE)
``` 

Finally, we estimate three equations models. The 4 socio-economic
covariates that were previously either included in the first or the
third parts of the formula are now split on these two equations. More
precisely, we assume that `educ` and `size` are the determinants of
the selection process and that `smsa` and `size` explain the frequency
of purchase. The first model is a double-hurdle model ; selection and
purchasing mechanism are effective and note that in this case, the
`h2` argument is set to `FALSE`). The last two ones triple-hurdle
models, with correlated and uncorrelated errors:

```{r label = threeeq}
L101D <- mhurdle(shows ~ educ + size | linc | 
                        smsa + age, data = Interview, 
                    h2 = FALSE, method = "bhhh", corr = TRUE, 
                 finalHessian = TRUE)
L101D2 <- update(L101D, start = coef(L101D), robust = FALSE)
L111D <- update(L101D, h2 = TRUE)
L111D2 <- update(L111D, start = coef(L111D), robust = FALSE)
L111I <- update(L111D, corr = FALSE)
L111I2 <- update(L111I, start = coef(L111I), robust = FALSE)
``` 

The results are presented in table \@ref(tab:estimations).

```{r label = tabmodels, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
models <- list(L110D = L110D, L011D = L011D,

#coeflabels <- gsub("h[1-3]\\.(\\w*)", "\\1", coefs)
``` 

```{r estimations, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', eval = TRUE}

       custom.coef.names = custcoefs,#[c(coefs1, coefs2, coefs3, coefso)],
       caption = "Estimation of cencored models for the fees and admissions good",

       groups = groups
       ) 
``` 


## Tests

The position parameter ($\mu$ in table \@ref(tab:estimations) enables
to test directly the hypothesis that the second hurdle is operative,
using a Wald-like test. For all the models, the hypothesis that the
coefficient is equal to 0 is highly rejected. Note also that the only
model which impose that the second hurdle is not operative (denoted
`L101D` in the table) has the worst value of log-likelihood.

The coefficient of correlation is highly significant for the
double-hurdle selection model, but not for the double-hurdle selection
model. For the most general three equations model, only the
coefficient of correlation for the first two equations is
significant. Formal tests for this two nested models can be performed
using a traditional log-likelihood ratio test:

```{r label = loglik, results = 'hide'}
library("lmtest")
lrtest(L111D, L111I)
``` 
or a Vuong test, which don't make the hypothesis that one of the
competing model is the "true" model:

```{r label = vuongnested, results = 'hide'}
vuongtest(L111D, L111I, type = "nested")
``` 

```{r label = hvuongnested, include = FALSE}
pvlr <- round(lrtest(L111D, L111I)[["Pr(>Chisq)"]][2], 3)
pvvuong <- vuongtest(L111D, L111I, type = "nested")$p.value
``` 

Both tests don't reject the independence hypothesis at the 5\% level,
especially the Vuong test, the p-values being respectively equal to
`r pvlr` and `r pvvuong`.

For non-nested models, one can use Vuong test, using the original
version or the non-degenerate version of @SHI:15. For example,
for the double-hurdles selection and ptobit models, the test is
performed using:

```{r label = vuongdh, results = 'hide'}
ndvuongtest(L110D, L011D)
``` 

```{r label hvuongunnested, include = FALSE}
unnested <- ndvuongtest(L110D, L011D)
stat <- as.numeric(round(unnested$trad$statistic, 3))
pvaltrad <- round(unnested$trad$p.value, 3)
pvalshi <- round(unnested$nd$p.value, 3)
``` 

The statistic is `r stat`.  Its negative sign indicate that the
p-tobit model better fits the data compared to the selection
model. The difference is significant at the 5\% level, as the
(two-ways) p-values equal `r pvaltrad` for the traditional Vuong
test and `r pvalshi` for the non-degenerate version proposed by
@SHI:15.

which leads to the conclusion that the ptobit model is significantly
better than the selection model.

The parcimony principal leads to the selection of the ptobit
double-hurdle model, as it is not significantly worst than the more
general three-hurdle model.
